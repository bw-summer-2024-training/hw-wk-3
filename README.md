## Coding task

Draft a short memo using the `state_funding_analysis.qmd` file in this repo. The file has a template set up that will require you to write a paragraph to respond to each of the following prompts:

-   Provide a short write-up on where you are at in the process of gathering your state's education finance data and other relevant student demographic information needed to complete the capstone project. 
-   If your state has a base funding amount, would you characterize it as adequate, inadequate, or too generous? How does it factor into funding policy conversations? Is it a "known" figure that features in debate/discussion, or is it more of a "hidden" element?
-   Are there any student or district categories in which your state does not have weights or funding streams for what you wish you did? Would you characterize funding allocated for low-income students, English learners, and/or students with disabilities as adequate and equitably distributed? Why or why not?
-   How do you think about the role of local funds in your systems? What's your ideal? What practical or political challenges do you anticipate around potentially changing the role of local funds?
-   Is funding for schools of choice a major concern for your state or your organization? How would you like to see schools of choice funded differently, if at all?

Be sure to use [the visual editor option in RStudio](https://posit.co/blog/exploring-rstudio-visual-markdown-editor/) to draft your response more easily.

As always, once you've completed the assignment, be sure to commit and push to GitHub!
